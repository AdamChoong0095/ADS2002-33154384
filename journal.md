ADS2002 week 2 entry

This week, I was allocated to my group and introduced to the technique of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify image data which belonged to a medical imaging dataset. Prior to the introduction of the topic, I conducted research on neural networks, in general, collecting resources and notebook tutorials on how to implement and optimise them. I shared to resources I found to my group members and helped them get TensorFlow (TF) set up as I had already used TF prior to the project’s introduction. No code was generated by our group as we were familiarising ourselves with the mechanics of TF, however, the resources I distributed assisted in this process. The source of the notebooks I distributed to my group members can be found here (the notebooks were in PyTorch but I explained to my group members that the processes explored and mechanics explained in the notebooks are similar to TF): https://www.learnpytorch.io. No particular insights were generated this week.

ADS2002 week 3 entry

This week I did basic exploratory data analysis and an assessment on the cleanliness of the data. This involved conducting research on the variables observed in the dataset. For example, I found out what CVC, ETT and NGT described in the dataset and their implications for determining a conclusive result for the project. Since it was relatively difficult to access the data, our group’s main priority was to decide our research question. I proposed that we study casual features in the images which are outlined by the training annotations data set and determine which feature seems to result in an improper placement of each given type of catheter. I also wanted to consider the reliability and accuracy of our predictions when applied to the testing set of images. My other group member suggested a research question about using our results to help streamline the catheter placement process for medical professionals and although the purpose of this project may be to assist in the automation of identifying of misplaced catheters, I believe their suggestion is too implicative meaning that it should be a question answered during the evaluation of the results. The current state of our code only deals with the contents of the csv files as indicated below:

To assist with comprehending the data, I wanted to answer the following questions: How many patients were being analysed? How many images were taken of each patient? How can I best choose a visual to represent the data? I did not manage to find an adequate way to visualise the data but next week, I aim to finish this process. The main insights that I generated, however, were to do with discovering what each variable meant in the context of medicine and radiology.
